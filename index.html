<h1>User First Software</h1>
<p>
User First is a software concept established in 2021.
The goal is to make software enjoyable to use while having an ethical base, which should respect users and their data in any possible way.
This concept can be applied to any kind of software like websites, computer desktop software, mobile applications and videogames.
</p>
<h2>Properties</h2>
<p>
  The software that uses this concept needs to have the following properties:
</p>
<h3>Property 1: Enjoyable</h3>
<p>The software should be as enjoyable as possible and should avoid annoying the user in any possible way. Examples of annoyances are (but not limited to):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unrequested obtrusive notifications.</li>
  <li>Mandatory update requests.</li>
  <li>Jumps in the user interface.</li>
<li>Bad/unintuitive ui/ux design.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Property 2: Transparency</h3>
<p>The software should never execute actions that the user is not aware of. The user should be informed about every action that the software makes.</p>
<h3>Property 3: No Ads</h3>
<p>The software should never have advertising of any kind.</p>
<h3>Property 4: No Tracking</h3>
<p>The software should never track nor record the users’ activity. By using the software, the users should be confident that their usage, location and all related information about them will never be tracked nor recorded by any means.</p>
<h3>Property 5: No Spam</h3>
<p>The software should never promote itself to get the user's attention by any means. This includes emails, notifications or any other way to contact the user. The only exception for this is the ability to inform the user about a new version of the software.</p>
<h3>Property 6: No Social Leaks</h3>
<p>The software should never post on social networks without the user's consent. Which should be by default off.</p>
<p>The software should never try to exchange users’ social network posting for upgrades or to unlock specific software elements.</p>
<p>Users’ contacts on social networks should never receive any invites or any kind of software self promotion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Special Section for Entertainment Software</h2>
<p>These properties are focused on videogame software.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Property 1: Complete Game</h3>
<p>The full experience must be available within the first purchase or giveaway. The software should not have any in-game purchases. Blocked levels, additional features or power-ups are only allowed if it is possible to unblock them by playing the game or winning previous levels.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Property 2: Free Updates</h3>
<p>All game updates should be free.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Property 3: No Free To Play</h3>
<p>The software should not be of “Free To Play” kind. This means that the software must not have in game purchases of any kind.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Property 4: No Forced Retention</h3>
<p>The software objective should be connected to the player’s development, amusement or education. Software behaviours that are exclusively to retain the users for using the software are not allowed.</p>


<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This concept was initially developed by Lucas Dima in December 2021.</p>
<p>Some properties were taken by the draft of <a href="http://arithmomania.lucasdima.com/2018/05/13/software-manifesto-5/">Game Software Principles</a> written in 2018</p>
