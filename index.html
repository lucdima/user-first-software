<h1>User First Software</h1>
<p>
  User First is a concept for software development which was established in 2021. The intention is to make software enjoyable for the user whilst maintaining the user’s ethical boundaries. This approach can be applied to any kind of software like websites, computer desktop software, mobile applications and videogames.
</p>
<h2>Properties</h2>
<p>
The software that applies this concept needs to have the following properties:
</p>
<h3>Property 1: Enjoyable</h3>
<p>The software should be as enjoyable as possible and should avoid irritating the user in any possible way. Examples of irritation for the user could be (but not limited to):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unrequested obtrusive notifications.</li>
  <li>Mandatory update requests.</li>
  <li>Jumps in the user interface.</li>
<li>Bad/unintuitive ui/ux design.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Property 2: Transparency</h3>
<p>
  The software should never execute actions that the user is not aware of. The user should be informed about every action that the software performs.
</p>
<h3>Property 3: No Ads</h3>
<p>The software should never include advertising of any kind.</p>
<h3>Property 4: No Tracking</h3>
<p>The software should neither track nor record the users`activity. In using the software, the user should feel confident that their usage, location and all information relating to their activity will neither be tracked nor recorded by any means.</p>
<h3>Property 5: No Spam</h3>
<p>The software should never promote itself to get the user's attention. This includes emails, notifications or any other way of contacting the user. The only exception for this should be the ability to inform the user about a new version of the software.</p>
<h3>Property 6: No Social Leaks</h3>
<p>The software should never post on social networks without the user's consent. Which should be turned off by default.</p>
<p>The user should never be offered additional benefits in exchange for writing positive messages about the software online.</p>
<p>Users’ contacts on social networks should never receive any invites or any kind of software self promotion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Special Section for Entertainment Software</h2>
<p>These properties are focused on videogame software.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Property 1: Complete Game</h3>
<p>
The full experience must be available once the videogame has been acquired by the user. The software should not include any in-game purchases. Blocked levels, additional features or power-ups should only be allowed if the user is able to unlock them when playing the game or completing levels.
</p>
<h3>Entertainment Property 2: Free Updates</h3>
<p>All game updates should be free.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Property 3: No Free To Play / In-App Purchases</h3>
<p>The software should not upsell any features which affect the playability.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Property 4: No Forced Retention</h3>
<p>The intention of the software should be to support player’s development, amusement or education. The software should not include any features which are used exclusively to retain it’s players.</p>
