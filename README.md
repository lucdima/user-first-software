# User First Software
User First is a software development manifesto established in 2021. Its goal is to make software genuinely enjoyable to use, while respecting the user's rights, privacy, and ethical boundaries.
This approach can be applied to any type of software — including websites, desktop applications, mobile apps, and videogames.
